# PersonalProjectGL
A personal project of mine that bring together fictional world locations and real locations.

This project was created and designed by Chase Olson. This app is uncompleted and is only up to provide
a sample of my Android App Creation. The database includes 4 locations, whereas in the ideal completed
app would include possibly hundreds.

The idea of this app was to allow users to bring this app with them while on vacation to a location
from a film or tv show and be able to compare these locations to the movie or tv scenes.

This app was made in Android Studio and utilizes Java, XML, SQLite, and Material Design. It includes
RecyclerViews, ViewPagers, CollapsingToolbars, Favorites, Image Galleries, Implicit Intents to YouTube
and Google Maps, Picasso, Expandable RecyclerView, and a whole lot more.

The app is on pause currently because of copyright permissions.
